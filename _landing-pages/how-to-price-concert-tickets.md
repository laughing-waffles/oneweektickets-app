summary_title: Ticket price discovery for the primary market
summary_body: |
  "Weâ€™re in an industry that prices its product worse than anybody else," stated Terry Barnes, former chairman of Ticketmaster, to the Wallstreet Journal. Promoters have imperfect tools to help them determine ticket prices. These tools tend to be a combination of dated historical data and gut feel.
  
  <b>But what if there was a better way?</b>

  OneWeek Tickets is a ticket sales platform that helps venues, artists, and promoters optimize concert ticket pricing. We maximize concert ticket sales volume and revenues with auction-based price discovery for any event.

  Historic box office data does not represent the current market conditions, nor does it help discover the individual price each fan is willing to pay for a concert ticket. 
strategy_title: Pay what you want
strategy_body: |
  Academic and economic research finds that auction pricing in the primary market significantly improves price discovery, <b>roughly doubles artist revenues</b> and minimizes the incentive of secondary market players to scoop up low-priced tickets and resell them on the secondary market. 

  OneWeek Tickets is different because our auction design utilizes a 7-day recurring blind auction, providing data to sellers and opportunities to buyers to engage in a conversation which results in the optimal market price to be discovered for any event.
