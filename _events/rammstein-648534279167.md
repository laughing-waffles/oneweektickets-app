In 2013, Rammstein played at several festivals after the release of their greatest hits album, bringing outlandish showmanship with them to each show. People who have seen this band in concert surely understand their legendary status. When these guys go on tour, it's a real treat for all who are lucky enough to have a ticket. Rammstein puts on huge shows, featuring pyrotechnics, light shows, larger than life backdrops and artwork, hydraulics and costumes to match. All of this doesn't even come close to matching the band members' stage presence and playing perfection, though. These guys could possibly be the hardest working musicians in the industry. They don't release a song until it is absolutely perfect, which is why it took them two years to record their album, "Liebe ist f√ºr alle da."

Rammstein is a band from Germany that formed in 1994. The devotion and dedication of the band members shows in the cleanly played music and perfectionist style of recording and in the fact that all the original band members still remain together to this day. This band is technically classified in the New German Hardness genre, but is more accurately described as a mixture of heavy metal, industrial and groove metal. Their song "Du Hast," which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Top 200 charts, may be the one that brought Rammstein to the general public's attention; it was even featured in the game "Rock Band 3." However, many fans of hard metal considered these guys to be rock legends way before the game came out; after all, it doesn't get any better than hard core metal sung in German.
