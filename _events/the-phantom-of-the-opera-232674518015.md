The Weeknd announced his new headline world tour, The After Hours Tour, starting Jun 11, 2020 on the heels of his upcoming album, After Hours. The tour showcases state of the art production and one of the most innovative stage designs to date, containing the most LED lights and video for an arena show. The 104-date global tour will kick off on Jan 14 in Vancouver at Pepsi Live at Rogers Arena with stops in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Paris, Berlin and more, before wrapping Nov 16 in London at The O2.

The worldwide tour announcement comes just days ahead of the multi-platinum singerâ€™s headlining Super Bowl halftime performance (Sunday, Feb 7) and includes a handful of rescheduled dates shifting from 2021 a part of the After Hours World Tour in 2022.
