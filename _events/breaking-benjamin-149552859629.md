Following the wrap-up of their North American co-headline arena tour with Korn, multiplatinum band Breaking Benjamin announced their 2020 US summer tour. The tour kicks off July 15th with very special guest opener Bush as well as Theory of a Deadman, Saint Asonia and Cory Marks includes stops at Jones Beach, Hartford, St. Louis, Dallas, Tampa, Phoenix, Nashville, Las Vegas and Irvine, CA to name a few. Breaking Benjamin is touring in support of their vast catalogue and latest release, Aurora, which showcases reimagined versions of the band's biggest and most popular songs, including "Dear Agony" as well as "So Cold" and "Red Cold River," both of which were #1 rock radio hits. Aurora also features multiple special guests, including Lacey Sturm (ex-Flyleaf), Spencer Chamberlain (Underoath), and Scooter Ward (Cold) who joins the band on the album's current single, "Far Away," which is currently Top 10 at rock radio.
