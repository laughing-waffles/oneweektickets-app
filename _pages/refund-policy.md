All sales are final. 

Once you enter a bid, you will have until the time stated on the email confirmation to withdraw your bid. If you do not withdraw your bid by that time, it is possible that your bid will be accepted and your credit card will be automatically charged. Once that occurs, you may not withdraw your bid and the sale is considered final.

If your bid is not accepted on a particular day's auction, your bid will remain active for the remaining auction days, if any. You will once again have until the time stated on the email confirmation to withdraw your bid. This will continue until there are no remaining auction days, at which point your bid will be closed and no sale will occur.
